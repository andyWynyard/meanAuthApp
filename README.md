# meanAuthApp

## MEAN authentication application

Can be used as a template for a bigger application. I will be using this in the future to build out other applications by forking is and continuing. 

Technologies used here:
1. Angular2
2. Node.js
3. Express
4. MongoDB

I am becomming a super fan of MongoDB. It is far superior (in my mind) to relational databases.
